## The Problem It Solves

Students often struggle to get instant, personalized help with complex academic problems — especially those involving math, code, or diagrams. Generic chatbots like GPT don’t offer visual input support, screen sharing, or real-time canvas collaboration.

**Bloom Education AI** solves that.

It combines cutting-edge Groq models with an intuitive UI that accepts:
- Voice input
- Image uploads
- Multilingual response

Users get instant feedback, step-by-step suggestions, and contextual help — whether they're solving equations, debugging code, or learning in their native language. It’s the next big leap for student productivity.

## Technologies We Used

React, TailwindCSS, Flask, Python, Groq API, Excalidraw, Screenpipe
